🧭 Step 1: Create the Project

Log in to ProjectManager.com
 and open your workspace.

On the left sidebar, click Projects → New Project.

Enter:

Project Name: Railway Reservation System

Start Date: (Pick today’s date or the one given by your instructor)

Optionally set an End Date if you know roughly when you want the project to finish.

Click Create.

🧱 Step 2: Identify and Define Project Tasks

These are the major work items for your system.
You can use these as a starting list (you’ll enter them as tasks):

#	Task Name	Description (optional)
1	Project Initiation	Define objectives, scope, and stakeholders
2	Requirements Gathering	Collect system and user requirements
3	System Design	Create architecture, database, and UI design
4	Development	Build the system modules
5	Testing	Perform unit, integration, and user acceptance tests
6	Deployment	Deploy system on live environment
7	Training & Documentation	Train staff and prepare manuals
8	Project Closure	Final review and project handover

Add these in the “Gantt” or “Task List” view.

⏳ Step 3: Define Duration for Each Task

Click in the Duration column beside each task.
Here’s an example (you can adjust based on project scale):

Task	Duration
Project Initiation	3 days
Requirements Gathering	5 days
System Design	7 days
Development	15 days
Testing	7 days
Deployment	3 days
Training & Documentation	4 days
Project Closure	2 days
🎯 Step 4: Define Milestones

Milestones mark major achievements (zero-duration tasks).
Add these below your relevant tasks:

Milestone Name	Linked Task	Duration
Requirements Approved	After Requirements Gathering	0 days
Design Completed	After System Design	0 days
System Live	After Deployment	0 days
Project Closed	After Project Closure	0 days

In ProjectManager, you can mark a task as a milestone by setting its duration to 0 days or checking the Milestone box.

🔗 Step 5: Define Dependencies Between Tasks

Dependencies show task order (e.g., Design starts after Requirements Gathering).
In the Gantt view, you can drag the connector line between tasks or use the Predecessor column.

Example sequence:

1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8


Milestones depend on their preceding task (e.g., Requirements Approved depends on task 2).

📅 Step 6: Define the Project Calendar

Go to Settings → Calendars.

Set working days (e.g., Monday–Friday) and working hours (e.g., 9 AM–5 PM).

Add holidays or non-working days if needed.

Save and apply this calendar to your Railway Reservation System project.

👥 Step 7: Define Project Resources and Resource Types

Go to Resources → Add Resource.

Examples:

Resource Name	Type
Project Manager	Work
System Analyst	Work
Developer	Work
Tester	Work
Trainer	Work
Server	Material

“Work” = people or time-based effort
“Material” = items or equipment

🧩 Step 8: Assign Resources to Tasks

In the Task List, click the Resource column and assign appropriate people:

Task	Assigned Resource
Project Initiation	Project Manager
Requirements Gathering	System Analyst
System Design	System Analyst, Developer
Development	Developer
Testing	Tester
Deployment	Developer
Training & Documentation	Trainer
Project Closure	Project Manager
📊 Step 9: Baseline the Project

A baseline freezes the current plan so you can later compare actual progress.

In ProjectManager:

Go to the Gantt view.

Click the “…” (More options) menu.

Choose Set Baseline → Save Baseline.
