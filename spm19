🧭 Step 1: Open or Create the Project

Log in to ProjectManager.com
.

In the sidebar, click Projects → All Projects.

If the project already exists (e.g., “First-Year Admission of Engineering”), click it.

If not, click New Project → Blank Project and name it:

First-Year Admission of Engineering

Set the Start Date (for example, today’s date).

Click Create Project.

🧱 Step 2: Create the Project Tasks (if not already done)

You can create a simple structure like this:

#	Task Name	Duration
1	Admission Announcement	2 days
2	Application Collection	10 days
3	Entrance Test	3 days
4	Evaluation & Shortlisting	5 days
5	Interview Process	4 days
6	Final Admission List	2 days
7	Fee Collection	5 days
8	Orientation	2 days

Add these tasks in Gantt or List view.
You can also define dependencies (e.g., Entrance Test can’t start before Application Collection ends).

🧭 Step 3: Update “% Complete” with Current Task Status

Now that your project is in progress:

Go to Gantt View or List View.

You’ll see a column labeled % Complete (if not, click Columns → Add Column → % Complete).

For each task, update progress:

Admission Announcement → 100% (finished)

Application Collection → 60% (in progress)

Entrance Test → 0% (not started)

Evaluation & Shortlisting → 0%

Interview Process → 0%

Final Admission List → 0%

Fee Collection → 0%

Orientation → 0%

This simulates real progress — some tasks are done, others ongoing.

📊 Step 4: Review the Status of Each Task

Click Dashboard or Overview tab.

You’ll see:

Tasks by Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)

Progress Summary

Upcoming Deadlines

Check if any task is delayed or behind schedule — ProjectManager shows red indicators for those.

✅ Tip: Hover over each task in the Gantt chart to see actual vs. planned dates.

🕒 Step 5: Compare Planned vs. Critical Path

The Critical Path is the sequence of tasks that directly affect your project’s finish date.

In Gantt View, click Options → Show Critical Path (this highlights critical tasks in red).

Look at:

Which tasks are on the critical path (usually Application → Test → Evaluation → Interview → Final List).

Are any of these delayed or still incomplete?

Compare current progress (from your % complete updates) with planned timeline:

If a critical task is behind, your end date will slip.

If non-critical tasks are delayed, the overall project might still be on time.

👥 Step 6: Review Resource Assignment Status

Go to Resources → Workload (or Team View).

You’ll see all assigned people and how busy they are.

Green: balanced workload

Red: over-allocated (too much work)

Check if someone is overbooked or has no assigned work.

For example:

“Admission Officer” might have 3 overlapping tasks.

“IT Support” might have none until the entrance test.

You can reassign or balance resources by dragging tasks to other people or changing assignment under the Task → Resources column.

🧩 Step 7: Monitor and Adjust

As days progress:

Keep updating % Complete daily or weekly.

Check Dashboard → Schedule Performance for slippage.

Review Critical Path often — if it shifts, adjust dependent tasks.

Communicate with team if something is delayed (ProjectManager lets you comment directly on tasks).

📈 Step 8: (Optional) Create a Baseline Comparison

If you created a baseline earlier (before execution), you can now:

Click Gantt View → Options → Compare to Baseline.

This shows planned vs actual visually — lines or bars showing delays or early completions.
